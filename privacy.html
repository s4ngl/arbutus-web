          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-iu-red mb-4">Liability</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an 'as
            is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, Indiana University
            Student Media makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby
            disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without
            limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability,
            fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of
            intellectual property, or other violation of rights.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            In no event shall Indiana University Student Media or its suppliers
            be liable for any consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or
            any third party arising from the use or inability to use this
            website or the materials on this website, even if Indiana University
            Student Media or an authorized representative has been notified,
            orally or in writing, of the possibility of such damage.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            In the context of this agreement, "consequential loss" includes any
            consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of
            profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of
            goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation,
            loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under
            statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity or
            otherwise.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
            warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
            incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
